            <p class="synopsis">When civil engineering student Suho Kim falls asleep reading a fantasy novel, he wakes
                up as a character in the book! Suho is now in the body of Lloyd Frontera, a lazy noble who loves to
                drink,
                and whose family is in a mountain of debt. Using his engineering knowledge, Suho designs inventions to
                avert the terrible future that lies in wait for him. With the help of a giant hamster, a knight, and the
                world's magic, can Suho dig his new family out of debt and build a better future?</p>
