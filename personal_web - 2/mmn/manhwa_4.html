            <p class="synopsis">Hanbin Ryu had just been aimlessly wandering since his discharge from military service,
                when he unexpectedly found himself transported to a different world. Unfortunately, his "guide line" - a
                tool provided to help him progress and thrive - was plagued with flaws, resulting in him being trapped
                in the introductory phase for more than two decades. Finally emerging from this grueling ordeal, he
                discovered that others had grown hostile towards outsiders such as himself. Can he manage to stay alive
                as a novice amidst these unfavorable circumstances?</p>
